# Project Pitches Blog: Visual Design Objectivity

The Phonixes did an excellent job with their app concept. Although it felt targeted at a more fashion-savvy consumer, the idea resonated heavily with me as someone who has almost no sense of fashion. There is a lot of potential for an app like this to have applications beyond helping users utilize their entire wardrobe. I would envision it being equally useful for helping users put together outfits that are actually stylish. Although the point is to minimize fast-fashion, I could envision a feature where the app suggests individual articles of clothing that could be used in multiple ways with the clothes people already have to allow users to diversify their closet greatly without needing to purchase full outfits.

In a similar vein, the idea of using an app to help people use what they have instead of buying more could very easily be applied to cooking. As someone who loves cooking, I often find myself with odd amounts of certain ingredients after preparing recipes and either get creative with what I cook or end up tossing the ingredient if I can't use it before expiration. Since food recipes are a little more hard-coded than fashion it could be easier to create an algorithm that figure out what recipes you could prepare with the food you already have or minimal new purchases. Even furter, the app could track expiration dates so that users always know if an ingredient is expired or when to throw it out. Although it addresses a completely different domain than fast fashion, it has the potential to not only help users decide what to cook but also reduce food waste and excess purchasing from grocery stores.
