# Blog 3: Response to Nisha's Post on PlantIt

Nisha! I'm glad you understood what we were aiming for and the concept of something small and somewhat cutesy appealed to you like it did for us :D. We've also had a lot of discussions about who to target and agree that moving forward with students or non-professional projects is probably the best way to go. That said your comment about linking a more tangible motivator to progress got me thinking....

My first thought was to continue with the student project side and explore if there was a way to more directly connect grades to the platform. Perhaps an integration with canvas (similar to what exists with gradescope) would motivate students a bit more by connecting the tangible world of grades with the slightly less tangible world of digital plants.

Hearing about sweatcoin perked my ears. It seems that they are able to introduce money into their ecosystem through paid ads, which is not something we'd be looking to do. That said, providing financial incentives would be more directly motivating. If used in a corporate environment, employers could provide small monetary (or other) bonuses to employees for succesful completion of tasks or even as a motivation to finish quickly. I could envision that users might increase productivity notably if there was a financial bonus to completing tasks quickly. That said, that could create other issues related to quality. More importantly, it could be a slippery slope that leads to employers trying to squeeze productivity out of employees by hooking them on small rewards. In an even more Orwellian (or Chinese) world, you might even motivate team members with social credit increases or the risk of demerits.

That said, our goal has always been to increase productivity by building people up with healthy tools and the student domain feels the most condusive to that. As a result, I'd consider throwing in a feature that allows a "prize" for whatever team member completes the most tasks or if a team member claims an unclaimed task.
