Task 1- If you’re actively logging in there should be some animation that shows that you’re actively logging in. Not sure if page was frozen.
Does not know what it means when things are checked. Play with it. When you complete a task you earn a flower in your garden. Each garden is a project (fairly intuitive)

What happens when you complete your garden? Nothing in this case, wants a reward. Also there is a maximum number of rewards

If you’re trying to make it something that people actually want to use, I feel like I should rewarded with more dopamine. Earn flower 5 is great. I COMPLETED THE GARDEN. Won the game

Task 2 - Does not understand why there are 2 flowers there when 4 tasks are complete. Seemed ot understand that could not finish task for other player clearly. Eventually realized only 2 flowers since only 2 tasks are completed that are theres. Looks a bit goofy when there is only one flower. Should show a percentage of completed or a shadow of flowers that need to be filled in. Needs to feel more like a game that I can win.

What is the status box? Pretty obvious already if its completed with checkmark and green highlight.

Looking at project they own. Liked it more. Because of visuals. Only creator can add tasks. Whoever didn’t create it should have an ability to request tasks to be created or allow other members to alter tasks.

Why is garden dynamic in one and not in the other. Get rid of the status column. Potentially add an assigned date.

Task 3 - “Just came”. Feels like I beat a level in Donkey Kong. Reflection of my graphics. Would be nice to have avatars to view users.

Would be nice to have something a bit more warm on the homepage other than just login to start. Info on what site is and who created it.

Task 4 - (pw 1)
Problem with password being too easy (Maybe add a minimum character length)

Error code comes up everytime he clicks anything

Created project Washing the dishes

Very quickly started making tasks after project was created. Good choice on location for task creation but didn’t create the task, instead went to add users vs. Added Alice but nothing changed (should show immediately without refreshing page).

Appreciated not being able to set deadline in past (although past included today)

Created task but it seems to have been created twice.

Task still got created with deadline in past just without a deadline.

Seemed to be able to see very clearly where to go to delete task but delete button didn’t actually work.

Appreciated not having to refresh after created new task

Confused why you can’t complete a task if you’re in charge of a project. Should be able to complete other people’s tasks

Task 6 - Edit task made choice of clicks super obvious. Clicking on old notes made sense. Also made sense to reassign. You should be able to open up a task for members to pick up, or for people to trade tasks.

Unsure about the colors, generally when dealing with software interfaces, theme feels weird, random, flowers doesn’t quite make sense. Idea makes sense but doesn’t quite fit together for some reason. If you’re going to lean into flowers/gardens, lean into it all the way. At least on homepage have some description. Maybe a couple sample gardens. Explain analogy on home page. It doesn’t quite pop. Beige and green makes me feel like a worm. Pick more neutral colors like black and white. Lean more towards neutrals, minimalist modern. A lot of people will pick up other people’s tasks.
