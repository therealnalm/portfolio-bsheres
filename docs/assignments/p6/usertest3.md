Finding a Project:
“Oh, cute logo”
I’m looking… I see my tasks here. And then, I see my gardens on the right
“It looks like I need to click on one of these to navigate to the project page”
Hovered over project title, expecting the hover action to allow him to travel to the project page
Clicks on garden
“Cool”

Completing a Task:
Smoothly navigates to the project page in an intuitive manner after learning how to do so in the last task
While on project page, reads through the available tasks
Navigates back to the home page
Notices that the homepage is where all of the tasks assigned to him across projects are located in an aggregated manner
Checkbox to complete the task is not immediately clear
At first, tried to edit the task; “I want to get into this task”
Eventually figures out he must check the box; marks the task as complete

Creating a new project - PM:
“I’m guessing it’s gonna be under Projects”
Correctly navigates to the Projects page
“What should it be named?” “Whatever you want”
Names the project some uncreative gibberish
“Done”
Is confused after being instructed to add users to the project
Tries to add a user with incorrect capitalization
Feels clunky to have to type the username exactly without autocomplete, dropdown, etc.
“What are we doing boys? Divide by zero error?" when he sees NaN
Navigates to the project page successfully

Assigning a Task - PM:
At first clicks on the calendar icon
“Oh I didn’t check if I could type the date in. Nice, looks like I can”
Types in tomorrow’s date
Intuitively uses the dropdown menu to assign the task to Alice
Is confused by the notes box; curious if it’s necessary
“Ok task created”

Editing a Task - PM:
Right away understands that he needs to click edit task in order to reassign Alice’s task to Bob
Got confused when instructed to change the task description
“Task description or task notes?”
“I don’t know what the task description is. I’m hoping it’s the notes”
Edits the task successfully

Editing Your Project - PM:
He easily completes this task
Seems to have a feel by this point for how the app works
