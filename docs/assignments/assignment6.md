| Share journal, unshare journal | Add the user named “John” to your grocery list and then add the user named “Frank” to your grocery list. | Since OpenJournal is a social media app, I want to check that the “social” aspect of it is easy to interact with               |
| View shared journal            | Log out of your account, log into the account named “Frank” and view the grocery list shared with you.   | Journals shared with you are on a different page than journals you create, so I want to be sure users can find both            |

## User Tests

# User Test 1: Mike

Task 1: After being told to create an account, log in, and make a post, Mike first scrolled around the home page and noted that it didn't make sense to be able to make a journal before logging in. He clicked the login button and created an account easily. He had already scrolled over the plus to make a post so went right back, wrote his post and posted it "I just made a post, nice." I should probably have a more informative home screen before users have to log in. <br/>

Task 2: He did not hesitate to make a grocery list and seemed to fully understand what to do since the button was right in the front. "That was pretty simple, I like the journal and its easier to notice because its right in the center. It's very easy to make the journal." Liked being able to change the box size for the text box in case he wanted to write a longer title. No issues here. <br/>

Task 3: Was able to remake another post without issues. When clicking on view contents, it took him to the login page instead of the contents of the journal. That said he clicked on the "view contents" of the journal he wanted to add to instead of view contents for self. Clicked on the "my journals". Apparently after refreshing the bug went away and he was able to see the contents of the grocery list. Did not know where to find the post immeadiately. He clicked on make new post as well. Eventually came to the conclusion that it was under "my contents". "that was actually quite intuitive". Had to click away from self journal to remember name of the grocery list journal that he wanted to add to. Ignoring the bugs, it seemed relatively intuitive although there should probably be some better indication of what the "self" journal is. <br/>

Task 4: "That was pretty quick". after successully adding both users. That said, the text in the add user box did not automatically empty so he had to delete John before he could write Frank. When going to remove John, accidentally left an extra space after the username so it didn't work. Eventually figured it out and was able to remove John. Should probably add some more reactive features to make adding/deleting users faster. The pop up messages were helpful. <br/>

Task 5: Logging out was easy (Settings icon was intuitive) as well as logging back in. Had previously clicked on shared journals so did not have an issue clicking on it. "That probably would have taken me a minute if I wasn't looking for where to log out earlier". But remembered that the left icon was shared journals. Might be good to add a written label of what the different menus are instead of just icons. <br/>

Overall: "Everything here was very intuitive especially the settings icon." Given some time believed a user could quickly learn to use the app. "Creating a journal 10/10". "Making a post was a little more challenging but in retrospect was very obvious." The bottom two buttons (my journals and shared journals) were a bit tough to figure out but make a lot of sense once you've used it. <br/>

- Major Issue: Create a more intuitive/natural approach/line with where you create posts vs. where you view them after being created.
- Minor Issue: Takes users a little bit to understand the my journals and shared journals buttons
- Moderate Issue: Certain buttons and functionalities did not work. Need to fix that

# User Test 2: Tom

Task 1: Very quickly found login button and created an account. When told to make a post, first created a journal thinking it was a post. Then started typing in the add user box. Did not have any idea about where to go to make a post and seemed to click on every button except for make a post before making a post. Even after hovering on the plus button, tried to click the plus instead the on "create a post". Did not like not being able to click the plus "Should be able to hover, read the label, and click instead of hover, move mouse, click". Very confused by one journal being able to add people and the other not. <br/>

Task 2: Was "woah now I have two journals." Chose to delete another journal that they had made erroneously because delete journal button was quite apparent. <br/>

Task 3: Creating a post this time was very fast and intuitive that said was upset when the post was not automatically in the desired journal. Took some time to figure out that he had to go to the self journal to find the post. Gave an exasperated sigh when he had to click away from the self journal to find the name of the grocery list journal that he wanted to add the post to. This took forever and was clearly very confusing. "I'm struggling to add the post to my grocery list because I can't figure out how to get into the journal". Tried to click on the box instead of view contents multiple times. Tried to delete self journal without fruition. Should consider adding a dropdown of available journals instead of requiring user to remember the name. <br/>

Task 4: This was incredibly quick. "That was intuitive, I liked that one". Although the usernames not deleting after hitting submit was confusing. Did not appreciate the location of the shared users list "I was that was further over and maybe bigger". <br/>

Task 5: First clicked on Frank's self journal before going to the shared journals "Aha! I found it." Appreciated that the shared journals had their own buttons and said that makes sense. "I feel like the icon should be people or something instead of more books". <br/>

Takeaways: Posting in a journal was difficult. The overall layout is fine although would have liked the icons to be at the top. Would like more info to be shared when hovering over icons (shared journal and settings icon).<br/>

- Moderate Issue: Unlabed icons were confusing. Should consider adding labels or popout labels when hovering.
- Major issue: The location of the post button and the ability to move posts once created was confusing. Should be able to select what journal posts go in when creating the post
- Moderate Issue: The home screen with journals has a lot of boxes and buttons that do simple things. Although this makes those actions easy to do, is a bit cluttered for the user experience.
