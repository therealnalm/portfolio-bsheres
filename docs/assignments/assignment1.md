# Assignment 1

**Conduct 2 Interviews to Test Social Media Hunch**

> Hunch: I would like to build a social media app for people who want a simpler experience to stay in touch with their friends. Users of Instagram, Snapchat, and others are getting caught up in all the other offerings and ads.

I'd chose to interview 2 relatively busy and/or succesful people who are at very different points in their life but still find time for social media. I'd like to interview one person who is very involved on multiple social media platforms and one person who is less active on social media. I'd like the latter person to be someone who has used social media for a long time as well in hopes that I can get perspective on how they've reacted to it changing over time. Since I do not use social media and do not have my own college-aged perspective, I would like to interview one person who fits that demographic.

## Interviewee 1: Mandhir Suri

Dr. Suri is a neonatologist with 2 grown-up kids. Although he grew up in India, he has lived in San Diego, California with his wife for nearly 20 years. I wanted to speak to Dr. Suri to understand how social media may be serving (or underserving) a busy professional who is well into a more mature phase of his life. Below is the summary of his interview. Click here for his raw interview notes.

Dr. Suri has 2 distinct uses for social media. Professionally, he uses doximity (a specialized social media for healthcare professionals) and telegram. His main use for these platforms is to communicate with other doctors around the world about new, interesting, or important research papers or cases since he does not have the time or resources to go through all new research or cases. The doctor community also uses these applications to provide opinions and support to each other on particular cases they may have. In his personally life he also uses Instagram, Tik Tok, and Whatsapp. He utilizes Instagram and Tik Tok to stay up to date on news or sports scores as well as learn new things, like how to cook, talk, or dress. He also utilizes instagram to post and views posts to stay in touch with friends and family. He finds its a good way to stay updated on peoples' lives despite having a very busy schedule. He also has a few whatsapp groups for smaller circles like his pickleball group, maternal family, and paternal family. He spends about an hour a day on social media split 50/50 between professional and personal. Although he expressed that he sometimes wasted time, he surprisingly pushed back against the idea of restrictions. "It is adictive, but I'm not against it because I learn all these new things. I wouldn't want less options and think I should control it myself." He brought up being very upset with the time ads waste and said he would be willing to spend $5-10/month to remove ads unprompted. He is also occaisionally upset by people's choice of what to post and wishes that there was a bit more censorship, but showed reserve about wanting to actively censor others.

## Interviewee 2: Meagan Rowlett

Meagan Rowlett is a student in her final year at MIT. She leads a very active lifestyle and is a very outgoing person. She frequently posts a compilation of videos from the past month to share with friends, so I was hoping to get the perspective of a college student who uses social media more frequently

Meagan uses social media for two primary purposes: social and individual. The main apps she uses are instagram and snapchat, both for similar purposes. She uses social media to connect with people who she is friends with, our has met before but does not use it to stay up to date on the lives of strangers. Rather, she views it as a way to stay in-the-know with people without having to reach out individually and have longer conversations about whats going on. In addition to that, she uses Instagram and snapchat as a form of personal diaries where she can keep track of what she's done, with who, where, and when. In addition to those 2 main uses, she also uses strava to keep track of her personal fitness and has a food review instagram account where she posts meal reviews and learns new recipes. She was hoping to use social media for 20 minutes a day, but currently averages between 60-90 minutes depending on the day. Despite that gap, she was not interested in a form of social media that helps her limit her usage and cited good self control as her reason. In addition she believed that "social media is an overall positive in my life".
One aspect she seemed partciularly passionate about was using social media as a personal diary for memories. She felt underserved by the extent of organizational features present via "highlights" on instagram and expressed
that she would want to be able to save longer notes than just a caption with these memories.

## Design Opportunities

> - Paid ad-free version. Although not all (most) users are not interested in paying for social media, there is a significant portion of the population that would be willing to spend money on a monthly subscription to remove ads.
> - Journal entries. This would provide the opportunity create posts with longer captions that serve as more personalized insights to remind the author of certain memories or potentially generate deeper conversation
> - Post-to-text. In an effort to stimulate more personal conversations instead of impersonal commenting, viewers of posts would have the ability to write a response that would be sent in messages to the poster as a conversation starter.
> - Memory/highlight organization. A combination of instagram's highlight features and snapchat's memory feature where the user can more deeply organize their posts on categories like location, users tagged, date range, time of day, or any custom category

## Raw Interview Notes

**_Interview 1. Dr. Mandhir Suri_**

Questions:
_Why do you use social media?_

I use social media professionally and socially. Professionaly I use telegram as well as some internal work ones like doximity (for doctors and healthcare workers). On the professional side, I'm not able to reach out to all professional papers in neonatology personally, but I am able to find papers linked from other practioners. I also listen to podcasts. Sometimes people post questions about difficult cases internationally. There are about 5-10k neonatologists who try to support each other on that app. On the social end, I use instagram, facebook (barely) and tiktok. Sometimes on Tik Tok I get medical references. I don't watch news on TV anymore so I get that mostly rough Tik Tok. I use instagram to stay in touch with family and friends.

_Why did you start using social media?_

Looking at the family end, its very difficult to stay in touch with all family and friends, and attend everyones events so its nice to be able to see all the pictures and videos. It's nice to be able to attend family social events without physically being there. Professionally, its very expensive to subscribe to every journal or take the time to look through them all so if someone is publishing a rare case somewhere in the world

_Who do you like to stay in touch with on social media?_

Family and friends. I divide my life. I do not put anything related to work or patient care on my instagram and snapchat. I have no interest in celebrities and don't care about Taylor Swift

_How do you interact with social media?_

I like to share my vacations, happy moments with family and friends. That is it. Just to share happiness with family and friends. Either through photograph or video, or even a chatgpt generated image. I do not Comment or like. I may choose to like.

_Who do you hope sees your posts?_

Strictly family and friends. During the election cycle I make no commentary

_Whose posts do you hope to see?_

I do see the news cycle through tik tok and instagram. As well as sports scores or other large events

_Are there any features that you wish social medias had?_

Sometimes I wish I could ping people when they get tagged in a picture.

_Are there any features you wish didn't exist?_

I think there should be a bit more scrutiny about the language that people use. There should be some form of censorship. People put whatyever comes to mind and those bad things lead to bad things.

Whatsapp is a good place to target closer friends or family if you don't want as much publicity. I do use whatsapp and groupme. Whatsapp for pickleball group, maternal family, paternal family.

_Why still use instagram and tik tok?_

Family is on whatsapp. Friends and family are on instagram. Its very difficult to manage groups of friends on whatsapp. I don't even know their birthdays anymore. They do comment on the posts which is nice

_How much would you like to use social media?_

I would rather not use social media, it takes a lot of time. I would prefer to spend 30-60 minutes. I probably spend half on education and half socializing and wasting. I wish I used less. I want to be in touch with reality and know what is going on in the world. I promise myself I won't use it some days. I think 20-30 minutes a day is fine

_What do you not like about social media?_

Sometimes you fall into a hole and you waste time. I realize I have spent 1, 2, 3 hours and wasted so much time. I would rather watch a documentary or go play pickleball.
Anytime I am not using social media I am doing better. Sometimes you start liking things and the algorithm keeps throwing more clips at you. So then you start liking even if you don't like it. Each 10-20 seconds adds up. I don't know if I would want a social media that didn't have an algorithm. It might help me control my time better, but sometimes you lose focus. My main goal is to know family and friends and nothing else.

_How do you think Social Media has changed over the past 10 years?_

Since covid. My usage has gone up. I hardly used to use it. It is addictive. I'm not againt instagram because I learn all these things like how to talk, how to cook, how to dress.

_How would you change social media? Would you remove any options?_

I wouldn't want a social media with less options. I think I should control it myself instead of being on a different platform and being restricted. I don't want the advertisements I would rather pay $5-10 for an ad-free platform so my time isn't wasted. I wish facebook or instagram had a premium subscription option to avoid ads. I'm not interested.

_What would you like to see in social media?_

On social media, sometimes when there is a bollywood song, I like it and haven't heard it. Sometimes when I like the song, its nice that you can make a clip out of it. I wish there was a link that would take me to where I can buy or listen to the full song instead of just using the clip. Same thing with movies or clips from movies but have a more direct. Same thing for sports, if theres a clip of the game or score somewhere, there should be a link directly to the game.

**_Interview 2: Meagan Rowlett_**

Questions:
_Why do you use social media?_

Its a cool way to stay connected with people without having to force conversation. I can look at pictures and know whats going on with people without talking to everyone individually. Its also a great way to store memories. For my instagram I post a lot of it for myself just to remind myself and summarize different times of my life.

_Why did you start using social media?_

In 8th grade my friends forced me to get instagram because they said I was socially dead. I keep using it because I like the ease of keeping in touch with people These are people I wouldn't be texting all the time. Each time you leave a chapter of your life you leave behind a lot of people you'd want to stay in touch with but can't as easily

_Who do you like to stay in touch with on social media?_

Depends on the format. I use instagram to stay in touch with most people I've met before in order for me to accept them, they must be within one degree of seperation. For snapchat its just people who I would say hi to in person. For stories and such, I'll look at anyone who I was friends with at some point. Getting someones snapchat is more intimate than instagram. There are a few people who I still snapchat because we started streaks back in 8th grade and that way I would still feel comfortable saying hi to them in person.

_Are there any other kinds of social media you use?_

I have a food instagram account, I have strava, I post end of year recaps on snapchat and I have a linkedin.

_How do you interact with social media?_

Instagram, for food account, use it to store photos chronologically. Compile photos and caption them, add location, tag people. Know when, where, with who a photo was taken. I use highlights as well a lot. I also repost photos for our soccer games. I DMed a very cute dog that I met in Spain one time. Snapchat has nothing partciularly special anymore. The idea of sending photos was cool but is not as popular anymore. Snapchat memories can save pictures and not take up space on your phone. I do that intentionally. I also really like the 1 year ago today feature because you can send it to other people. Sometimes I message people individually usually for memories or some people only use snap. Strava, its cool to see your workout and all the stats. If you follow your friends they can see and Comment

_Who do you hope to interact with on social media?_

Unless you're tring to be an influencer or are too easily swayed to be an influencer most people keep it private to their friends. It's so easy to find info for people online. I feel like people could stalk me pretty easily

_Whose posts do you hope to see?_

I'm not interested in seeing anything from celebrities other than the US women's soccer team. I think I follow way more content than I share. 90% of the time I'm lurking or commenting. The other 10% I'll share something or communicate.

_Are there any features that you wish social medias had?_

I wish there was a way to tag/label photos to organize them. I wish you could organize them so you had an area like highlights that was easy to be seen and be labeled like "beach pictures" or "boston food"

_Are there any features you wish didn't exist?_

I don't like the ads. The idea of likes is kind of stupid but I don't really care that much. I wouldn't pay for social media without ads, especially when you're used to mindless scrolling.

_Do you wish the mindless scrolling stopped?_

Yes, but I don't really mind. I hate when it shows me people I don't follow. If I wanted to find new people I'd go to the explore page. I don't have an issue falling down the endless pit.

_How much would you like to use social media?_

20 mins /day

_How much do you use social media now?_

1-1.5 hrs, really varies (depends on how busy)

_What changes could there be?_

None really, mental weakness is kind of the issue. I was reading about this and in order to avoid watching tv, you have to make it harder to watch the tv. If there was a way to make it harder to use social media. Issue is some people will just create a new app and so yours loses out.

_What do you not like about social media?_

Scrolling, and spending more time on than you want to. Comparison of yourself to others is a huge issue especially for younger women. Everyone always puts their best self out. For people who are addicted they spend more time there than in real life. It also promotes ADHD habits because of the constant dopamine hits. Photoshop

_Do you want to stop using social media+why?_

I have considered it and didn't because I think it is an overall positive because I am able to stay in touch with other pepole but I think I can control myself well enough.

_How do you think Social Media has changed over the past 10 years?_

Before, it was more about each individual, it was a way to showcase yourself and now sports teams and companies do. Everyone whos trying to promote something has social media. There is a lot of inspiration now compared to before.

_Has it changed for the better or for the worse?_

Its very tough to say. I want to say its better but theres so much false informatoin and the algorithm will labeled you down rabbit holes. A friend broke up with their ex and then she went and stalked a bunch of girls from his high school and then it kept suggesting all these girls at his high school.

_How has your social media use changed?_

When I first got it, it was largely negative. Now I respect that it has a lot more to do with posting about yourself for other people's attention. Its also really good for informatoin because I've gotten a ton of recipes from it. It's a more interesting way than just going on a website to find a recipe for banana bread.

_Any other thoughts?_

I think the strava thing is pretty cool because there is a specific community they're targeting. They took a community and made something for them specifically. Belly for food people. Rate my poop in high school (don't look into it). I'd be interested in a Bereal but more of a journal type. Once a week get a prompt and have to write in tandem with the picture(s)
