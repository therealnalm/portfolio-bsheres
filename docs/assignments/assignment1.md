# Assignment 1

**Conduct 2 Interviews to Test Social Media Hunch**

> Hunch: I would like to build a social media app for people who want a simpler experience to stay in touch with their friends. Users of Instagram, Snapchat, and others are getting caught up in all the other offerings and ads.

I'd chose to interview 2 relatively busy and/or succesful people who are at very different points in their life but still find time for social media. I'd like to interview one person who is very involved on multiple social media platforms and one person who is less active on social media. I'd like the latter person to be someone who has used social media for a long time as well in hopes that I can get perspective on how they've reacted to it changing over time. Since I do not use social media and do not have my own college-aged perspective, I would like to interview one person who fits that demographic.

## Interview Questions

## Interviewee 1: Mandhir Suri

Dr. Suri is a neonatologist with 2 grown-up kids. Although he grew up in India, he has lived in San Diego, California with his wife for nearly 20 years. I wanted to speak to Dr. Suri to understand how social media may be serving (or underserving) a busy professional who is well into a more mature phase of his life. Below is the summary of his interview. Click here for his raw interview notes.

Mandhir has 2 distinct uses for social media. Professionally, he uses doximity (a specialized social media for healthcare professionals) and telegram. His main use for these platforms is to communicate with other doctors around the world about new, interesting, or important research papers or cases since he does not have the time or resources to go through all new research or cases. The doctor community also uses these applications to provide opinions and support to each other on particular cases they may have. In his personally life he also uses Instagram, Tik Tok, and Whatsapp. He utilizes Instagram and Tik Tok to stay up to date on news or sports scores as well as learn new things, like how to cook, talk, or dress. He also utilizes instagram to post and views posts to stay in touch with friends and family. He finds its a good way to stay updated on peoples' lives despite having a very busy schedule. He also has a few whatsapp groups for smaller circles like his pickleball group, maternal family, and paternal family. He spends about an hour a day on social media split 50/50 between professional and personal. Although he expressed that he sometimes wasted time, he surprisingly pushed back against the idea of restrictions. "It is adictive, but I'm not against it because I learn all these new things. I wouldn't want less options and think I should control it myself." He brought up being very upset with the time ads waste and said he would be willing to spend $5-10/month to remove ads unprompted. He is also occaisionally upset by people's choice of what to post and wishes that there was a bit more censorship, but showed reserve about wanting to actively censor others.

## Interviewee 2: Meagan Rowlett

Meagan Rowlett is a student in her final year at MIT. She frequently posts a compilation of videos from the past month to share with friends, so I was hoping to get the perspective of a college student who uses social media more frequently
