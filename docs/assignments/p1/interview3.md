# Interview 3: Ashley

Ashley, a student at MIT.

## 1. Interviewee Background

**What kind of projects have you worked on in the past? What roles did you have in these projects?**

- Short term product design projects that usually doesn’t go to market, student lead ones.

**What were your reasons for doing these projects? (Did you feel passionate about them? Did you have any trouble motivating yourself to do them?)**

- Some of them are for classes others are teams that I’m interested in (FSAE) end product is something I’m interested in, try to figure out how to get there

## 2. General Project Operations Background

**What do you find are the most common roadblocks that you run into when working on a project in a team setting?**

- Most recent projects have been at MIT so you run into a lot of technical students who tend to optimize something that shouldn’t exist. Get hyper focused on little tasks without understanding the system as a whole

_How to fix that?_

- Make everyone not only work on design projects but also work on implementation. Watch people use it.

**How do you track your progress on projects? Do you/Does your team set goals? How easy is it to keep track of these checkpoints?**

- I use gantt charts. “I love me a good gantt chart” if I’m on a team there will be a sub-team lead and each task will have someone assigned to it. Important to have each person feel responsible for something. One issue is that students don’t feel responsible for each individual part of it. Project management sheet is separate from Gantt chart (more for product management and system architecture). Gantt is what effects what when and project management is how.

**How do you keep yourself motivated to continue the project? How do you (or your manager) help incentivize your team members to stay on track?**

- I see what needs to get done and when it needs to get done and I do it. For other people its important to find a way to make it personal, or add personal responsibility. If they don’t feel responsible they won't do it. Positive feedback is important, make them feel good. Say nice things, show interest in their ideas.

- Its especially important in course 2 that you have a specific prototype that kids can touch. Otherwise its harder to get things done because they can’t see and touch each part. Can't just be CAD

- The only issue with the Gantt chart and project management sheet is when kids aren’t doing their job. When kids aren’t working, one good way to make sure they stay on the task is that they understand its facing an important person (professor) and that their name is very obviously attached to it.

_Deal with multiple people on a task?_

- Never give one task to multiple people. A group can have a goal but each goal must be divided into individual tasks for individual people

_Case study?_

- In .009, we were in limbo because decisions were not clearly made (not everyone on same page) implementing the project management sheet allowed people to very clearly see decisions that had been made so we could move on. It appears that people don’t trust each other on a team when they can’t see why a decision was made. Very important to have succinct reasons for why decisions were made and have it forward facing. Important to have the goal constantly reiterated so that people are moving towards it and don’t get stuck in rabbit holes.

_Anything else to consider or keep involved?_

- Something that I could play with would be to have someone type in their skills and interests (for them to be proud of) make that cross section available so that everyone knows the other peoples’ skillsets. I spend a lot of time asking people if they’d be interested in doing something trying to find the right people for the task. Could also be interesting to have an end goal, and begin to work backwards. “We want to make a car by this date with these subsystems and each are assigned a percentage of progress. Need to actually weight importance of tasks” its not always aligned which tasks are important so not just for relative importance but to highlight what they shouldn’t waste time on. For .009 they got feedback that they needed multimodality in exposure to the patient. Your device needs to make noise to incentivize right behavior. Would be nice to provide some sort of behavior change. Example: you have chatgpt with the voice next to you. Perhaps supplement it with previous project milestones so you can see where other people have been and help you facilitate doing something properly. Be wary of gamifying. Truly gamified is hollow, not enough is boring. If there was a course 2 app and you could upload some type of 3d model that would highlight what you’re working on now and what you’re moving onto. Something to provide
