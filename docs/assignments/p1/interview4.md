# Interview 4: Andy

Andy, an instructor for 2.009 at MIT with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design.

## 1. Interviewee Background

**What kind of projects have you worked on in the past? What roles did you have in these projects?**

- He worked in model making, prototyping, pre-productiong manufacturing, and production development.
- Basically making first 10, 100, 1000 prototypes. Early production Has been the individual designing the processes in the machine and then teach that to workers

**What were your reasons for doing these projects? (Did you feel passionate about them? Did you have any trouble motivating yourself to do them?)**

- Mostly professional projects. Restored cars, built boats, expanded

**Do you have any upcoming projects? Who are the people that you are working with? (Do you know them? Do you trust them?)**

- Working for a company (Revision Military, VT) doing R&D on next-gen army helments. Balistic and regular helmets. One of the snags was that one of the group managers/directors was fixated on a specific tech to build them that wasn’t working very well. They had a sunk cost in several of those machines. The process was well known but the result was very labor intensive to bring from mold to a usable product.

- Put fabric into mold, one side was aluminum, other side was silicon blob that pressurized the fabric.

- One of the other guys didn’t like that setup, but wasn’t good in a meeting and so he got run over by the manager in meetings so the ideas weren’t coming through. Finally, one of the other high level people was alerted and the tech was switched. Was given 2 weeks and resources to build a better product and was successful

- Manager feared losing power if he let a different idea go through. Personality clash issue. One too strong one not enough.

_Does that happen a lot?_

- Definitely happens. Other times mistakes are made at such a high level that.

- Bullies tend to run meeting. Had firing ability. Was rarely there with peer supervisors or his supervisors although his behavior changed dramatically. Problem with arrogance and ignorance. People are employed because they came with one idea. A lot of the team had a good idea that the manager was a problem but people weren’t willing to speak up. A lot of the other people in the trenches had very good ideas that didn’t get heard because it conflicted with the bully’s mentality. Really good smart people (true genius or two) but until the bully left they were wasting millions of money chasing the wrong ideas.

## 2. General Project Operations Background

**What do you find are the most common roadblocks that you run into when working on a project in a team setting?**

- A lot of the issues is human nature. People spend their time on an idea and get attached to them. Lot of complacency with sticking with a single idea. Pride for their own product/idea. Why are we suddenly fixed on a specific idea? Need to do more exploration of options. That is not always a company habit. There wasn’t always an agreed upon process of exploration and refinement. Need to ensure that you’re going through the cycle. Through testing you select one. Inside that idea space you expand out and then expand back in, expand back out and go back in. Ignoring that means you’ll spend years on the wrong idea. Going through a proper process where you chase every lead down to round will result in better final product and save a lot of headache on the way.

- Sometimes there are one or two people who are the literal roadblocks.

_.009 team that fails, why?_

- I see a lot of issues with students who are not coming with a physical understanding of how things work. They need to get out in the garage to understand how the tools work. If they have not spent time with their hands on the product they won’t understand how it works. Its an experiential sense of what will work. Too much time on their damn phones.

- CAD should be where you go after you know what you’re building, not before. Only once you’re getting into a further phase should you go digital with CAD. It also builds a very strong sense of investment in something that may lack actual basic logic. General trend since WWII when ½ the population worked on the farm and now people have no idea since they don’t have hands-on experience. If you can’t fix stuff you can’t make stuff. Basic sense of building things in real world.
  We’ve never had to fix cars on the side of the road.

_Are there any social dynamics that pop up?_

- I’ve worked with 5-6 years of classes and don’t see any consistent issues. Sometimes you get a team where some people don’t do anything. That forces you to come together and get everyone to work. Working as a team is more valuable than the final product.

_How can you avoid lazy/shy kids not contributing?_

- As a shy kid I wouldn’t raise my hand for ear of embarrassment, I’m sure some of them are too shy to be involved. Some of the kids leading the show are not the best leaders. To get the shy kids to step up. Its not that they’re lazy they just haven’t been given something to do. It’s possible that one way to do this would be to have a rotation of responsibilities so everyone gets to be in charge. Or everyone has to lead a subteam at some point? I think even the leaders are people too and they can sense that others on the far side of the table are hiding. Being people in early stages of their career they might not have the tools to reach out to the nonparticipants that they can reach out to those kids. Yoda school is for people who don’t get along or don’t show up. Need to make sure that uninvolved kids are brought in early.

_Does it ever come down to lack of motivation?_

- It’s harder to notice the lazy kid since they can be hiding a multitude of motivations. Every motivation you can think of has to be a possibility.

_How do you handle personal projects?_

- I have a house and two kids. I have tons of projects. Two daily drivers I maintain. I do it between football and hockey practice. I have a 73 land rover project that was given to me and needed everything fixed. Needed to do deep research. Make spreadsheets on prices. Need to make sure everything else was fixed reasonably before wife would let him continue with the rover. Got a new chassis, started with axles did everything on nights and weekends. Started 8 years ago, and it was all consuming. Had a fire to continue with it. Joined forums online, contributed, got very involved. Two years after it went in the barn it came out drivable. Now moving past MVP. Figuring out all the issues was a second round of issues than happened after 4 years. Took another 6 months to finish the second round of repairs. Having issues with carburetors and figured out the issues. Electronic carburetor replacement costs 4x the mechanical. Its a constant challenge and back and forth between trying solutions and issues. Can fix or build anything he needs to.
