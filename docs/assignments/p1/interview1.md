# Interview 1: Anne

## 1. Interviewee Background

Anne, a 21 year old living in Massachussetts, working mainly in Data Science/Big Data space.

**What kind of projects have you worked on in the past? What roles did you have in these projects?**

- Worked on different data-related projects in the past
- Usually role is to work with the raw data and try to extract insights that can be translated for useful business situations. often times i’m working with another DS (perhaps as a mentor or someone who validates my work for example), and then some PMs— i have conversations with them about the direction the application of my work

**What were your reasons for doing these projects? (Did you feel passionate about them? Did you have any trouble motivating yourself to do them?)**

- Really enjoy making tangible impacts on a business, for example, from data. i think sometimes it can be hard to motivate myself through the processing and cleaning of the raw data parts of a project but overall it’s always really rewarding having conversations with my teammates and seeing my ideas or the project result have an impact

**Do you have any upcoming projects? Who are the people that you are working with? (Do you know them? Do you trust them?)**

- Upcoming project in class at school (NLP)

## 2. General Project Operations Background

**What do you find are the most common roadblocks that you run into when working on a project in a team setting?**

- One roadblock I’ve experienced is when different tasks in a team project depend on each other, so sometimes I get stuck and can’t do my part of the project because I am waiting for someone else to finish their part.

_How so?_

- Sometimes I’m in a group setting and we agree on when we want things done by, but sometimes we don’t anticipate that different tasks will be quite so interconnected, or sometimes people don’t finish their parts by their promised times. and it’s hard to fix that by the time it’s happening which is frustrating.

_Anything else?_

- one other roadblock is that for tasks that require multiple people to be working together, it can be hard to find time to schedule a time for all of us to meet together. it’s easier to work on projects in teams when we can break apart tasks into smaller pieces and then work on them individually and just check in with each other and give feedback asynchronously.

**How do you track your progress on projects? Do you/Does your team set goals?**

- Overall we usually scope out the project at the beginning and outline the main tasks that we’ll need to accomplish and when we roughly want to accomplish them by. then we usually split tasks into different people, often people will pick the tasks they’re strongest at. we check in with each other over text or over slack to update each other on the work we’re doing which helps us keep track of things.

_Where do you usually scope out the project?_

- Usually all the project planning we do just happens in a google doc or something similar to that, that we write all together when we’re meeting the first time. we’ll make bulleted lists or tables with the different tasks and when we imagine getting them done by, and a column or some notes on their statuses or their prerequisites or other notes we need to make.

_Do you have an example?_

- For example when i interned at dropbox and was working on a team project, we had one main document with all the different steps broken down and when we wanted them done by. and if there was a change in the plans it was really important to update the doc so that other stakeholders could see that those changes were being made.

**How easy is it to keep track of these checkpoints?**

- I’d say it’s pretty easy overall if the project is not too complex. like again with dropbox, when it was my intern project that had just me and a handful of other people involved, and was pretty timeboxed, it was pretty easy to manage. but towards the end of the summer i got involved in some larger-scale company projects and was doing work and giving my input into those things, and the management of that was really intimidating to even engage in.

_How was it intimidating?_

- Those projects had a lot of different teams and stakeholders involved, so having everything in one document made it really hard to focus in on what was exactly going on that was relevant to me. On top of that, sometimes i would get tagged into discussions that were happening in the comments of other peoples’ or teams’ checkpoints and it would be hard to keep track of those new responsibilities or discussions.

**How do you keep yourself motivated to continue the project? How do you (or your manager) help incentivize your team members to stay on track?**

- i dont i just have a fear of failure

## 3. Specific Project (Team)

Data Science project at a small edutech startup last summer.

**What were your incentives for doing this project?**

- I am generally pretty passionate about education, especially childhood and early childhood education, and so an opportunity to use data to help improve curriculum or assessments was pretty exciting to me.

**Who was involved in this project?**

- Was doing data science with one other intern and also working with a PM, two SWEs (they acted as data engineers to me for the purpose of the project), and the CEO

**What was the organizational structure of the project? (i.e. hierarchy–who answers to who? Who assigns tasks?)**

- Generally the PM was in charge, but i assume she took marching orders from the CEO. she managed both the engineering team’s schedule and tasks, and she also managed the intern projects for that summer. i would update her on my work or if i had questions

_How did you interact with the CEO?_

- We would more just meet to discuss the broader picture and direction of the company so i could understand what her mission and values were. we didn’t really discuss task-level details.

**What was the workflow like? How were deadlines set?**

- Everything was discussed in slack, or over zoom calls or weekly 1:1s. i was assigned deliverables from the PM during meetings and then everything beyond the deliverables was up to me and the other intern. we decided deadlines for the deliverables based on how many we had and how long we had (aka the summer). for tasks i just estimated how long i would need for things and set deadlines myself and communicated them

**Could you track the project’s progress at all?**

- yeah at least for my work, i mostly just tracked it against my own communicated plans and strategies. especially after the first month, i had a pretty good idea of how long different tasks would take and so i could make pretty reasonable plans and refer to them.

**How did you know that the other people were doing their part?**

- if i depended on the work, i would check in with them to ask if they had done what i needed, and that’s how i’d confirm that. if i didn’t depend directly on that work, i just hoped for the best more or less.

**Did you run into any major issues with regards to project management or structure (i.e. unrelated to the project content)?**

- for one task the other intern was taking forever and then i had to just do it instead. probably if we had a centralized task management database that contained both intern projects this could have been rectified sooner, or if the other intern and i were less siloed in our independent parts of the project.

## 4. Project Management Methods

**What is your experience with project management apps or software? (if any)**

- i used trello for a urop once, other than that i’ve always just been in google docs or like the internal dropbox equivalent for google docs or whatever

**What were the things that you didn’t like?**

- i really hated trello it didn’t work very well with how i think about tasks and subtasks and iterating on those things overtime (eg having a task and then finishing it but then “reopening” it, or a subtask open over for a long period time and then just sitting in “in progress” for forever)
