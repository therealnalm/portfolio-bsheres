# Interview 2: Emily

## 1. Interviewee Background

Emily, 20, a CS major at Georgia Tech living in North Jersey.

**What kind of projects have you worked on in the past? What roles did you have in these projects?**

- Composable documentation project at InterSystems (summer intern) - main architect for the project, designed and built system
- Bounce
- personal portfolio
- personal project
- Greenplate project
- Sustainability mobile app
- Scrum Master
- On The Lingo (startup project for class)
- AI language learning mobile app
- co-founder, developer

**What were your reasons for doing these projects? (Did you feel passionate about them? Did you have any trouble motivating yourself to do them?)**

- Composable documentation - first time working for a company, which she found exciting. InterSystems gave her a lot of flexibility and found the project interesting.
- Bounce - passion project and she believed it was a useful tool for herself
- Greenplate project - for a class, very difficult to find motivation
- On The Lingo - for a class, slightly motivated because she was interested in learning how to use React native

**Do you have any upcoming projects? Who are the people that you are working with? (Do you know them? Do you trust them?)**

- No

## 2. General Project Operations Background

**What do you find are the most common roadblocks that you run into when working on a project in a team setting?**

- everyone has a different level of motivation so hard to align motivations, especially if she’s more interested in the project than others
- can’t count on others to finish their parts of the project, which might be blocking her parts, if they’re not motivated
- different levels of knowledge/expertise/skill sets

**How do you track your progress on projects? Do you/Does your team set goals?**

- Notion - will usually have a Notion workspace for each group project. Task table to keep track of tasks and assign them to people. Everyone’s task is on the same board and shows everyone’s progress.
- Good reminder tool to remind other members of their tasks

**How easy is it to keep track of these checkpoints?**

- Easy if people use it, but many people will only update it once a task is completed. They do not update the task to show that it is in progress.

**How do you keep yourself motivated to continue the project? How do you (or your manager) help incentivize your team members to stay on track?**

- Motivation - get good grades
- Incentive - remind them their grade is on the line and that deadline is approaching

## 3. Specific Project (Team)

**What were your incentives for doing this project?**

- good grades

**Who was involved in this project?**

- her friends who were in the class and her TA

**What was the organizational structure of the project? (i.e. hierarchy–who answers to who? Who assigns tasks?)**

- Scrum Master - herself, she would hand out tasks
- everyone else was team member under her

**What were the main channels of communication?**

- group chat (iMessage)

**How did you know what tasks needed to be done?**

- given to them by professor

**How were deadlines set?**

- by professor

**Could you track the project’s progress at all?**

- Notion - wasn’t that useful because not updated/used, especially towards end of project. Had generic task list but not as detailed as rubric, which was what actually mattered for grade because she wasn’t very attached to Notion, only using it for other people’s benefit.
- Difficult because of so many members.

**How did you know that the other people were doing their part?**

- Checking the Notion
- Following up in the group chat to see if other members did their parts

**Did you run into any major issues with regards to project management or structure (i.e. unrelated to the project content)?**
**Can you think of ways in which you might rectify these issues?**

- at first, picking tasks from task list
- soon, ran into problem of tasks being dependent on each other, leading people to block others by not completing their task
- by the end, they would group dependent tasks together and assign to one person. still have to balance equal work among members
- solution by the end is somewhat good solution but can’t think of any better solutions since people like to do stuff last minute

**Did you find yourself feeling unmotivated or uninterested in doing your assigned tasks? What about your team members?**

- herself - unsure on how to proceed with some of your tasks so she would put it off until later. basically didn’t wanna do it cause she didn’t know how to start. also had more important stuff to do
- team members - definitely unmotivated, they hated hw and also unsure on how to do some tasks, which is unmotivating. everyone is working on something different so it’s harder to collaborate and help each other

**What are ways in which you think the process could have been improved, if at all? What do you think would have made the process better? (More efficient? More collaborative?)**

- were supposed to have daily scrum meetings, but they didn’t. maybe daily scrum meetings/standups would have helped make people more accountable. also might motivate people to do work since it might be embarrassing to show up to standup with no progress. would also keep each other updated and let people help each other during meetings

## 4. Project Management Methods

**What is your experience with project management apps or software? (if any)**

- Notion - use it for information wiki (e.g. ideas, projects)
- Things 3 (To Do List)
- Confluence for summer internship

**What were the things you liked?**

- Notion - freeform building what you need, very powerful
- Things 3 - more structured for specific purpose so better at that specific purpose (To Do List and Project Management focused)
- Confluence - more structured, having her own space, transfer unfinished tasks from day to day, feeled accomplished when finishing tasks, section for backlogged tasks and any questions she had
- Habitica (gamify your life, complete habits, dailies, to do list, quests & challenges) - fun

**What were the things that you didn’t like?**

- Notion - takes a lot of time to set up since you have to make everything yourself
- Things 3 - didn’t click with it, not free, unmotivating
- Confluence - coworkers could see her list
- Habitica - unmotivated cause she didn’t wanna do tasks and died
